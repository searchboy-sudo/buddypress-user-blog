# Purpose
An inline frontend block editor for use with or without buddypreess. Need help for those who want to contribute. For those that would like to contribute I think using this https://github.com/tomjn/p2020/issues/2#issuecomment-671303591 AND https://github.com/tomjn/block-comments/pull/9 to create a standalone plugin for easy user blog post creation would be amazing. My skills arent up to the task right now but I'm learning. Anyone who wants to contribute and speed this along, please feel free!!
